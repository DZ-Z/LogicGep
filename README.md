# [LogicGep: Boolean gene regulatory network inference using gene expression programming from times-series transcriptomic profiling data](https://github.com/DZ-Z/LogicGep)

![Screenshot](Data/MarkFIG.jpg)

In this work, we proposed a new method for BN inference from time-series transcriptional profiles, called LogicGep,
which reconstructs the network topology and identifies each geneâ€™s Boolean update function with a low time
complexity
